# Volcano Integration for Home Assistant

**This integration is under heavy, active development. There may be multiple updates per day, possibly resulting in errors or disruption to the integration or Home Assistant. I will change this notice once the software is available for a proper release.**

A custom Home Assistant integration to connect and control the **Storz & Bickel Volcano Hybrid Vaporizer** via Bluetooth. This integration enables precise control over the vaporizer's heat and pump functions, real-time monitoring of temperature, and seamless automation into the Home Assistant scripting and automation systems.
